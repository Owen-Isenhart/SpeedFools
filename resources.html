            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>
                    Go <a href="https://wermi.neocities.org/emuguide/getting_emu/#download" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to download and setup the 1.6.1 version of the Project64
                    emulator.
                    Then, legally obtain a ROM of Super Mario 64. Generally, you'll want to use a Japanese copy for
                    every category except for 70 star. To record your game, you'll want a recording software such as <a
                        href="https://obsproject.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">obs</a>.
                    For a more in-depth description for the optimized emulator setup, <a
                        href="https://wermi.neocities.org/emuguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click
                        here</a>. <br>
                    <br>If you do not already have a controller, the most recomended way is to buy an n64 controller or a hori, and then a <a
                        href="https://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/n64_usb_adapter_gen3/index.php" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">raphnet adapter</a> to convert to USB. There are many places to find
                    reliable N64 and hori controllers, but one of the most trusted places is the SM64 discord's
                    marketplace. A link to the discord can be found in the "How can I get involved with the community"
                    dropdown.

        </div>

        <div class="dropdown">
            <h3>How can I play on N64? <span>▼</span></h3>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>
                    For buying an N64, look on sites like Facebook Marketplace, ebay, or the SM64 discord, the link to
                    which can be found in the "How can I get involved with the community" dropdown.
                    If possible, try to find a "region free" N64, which will allow you to play both NTCS and JPN cartridges. For recording your game, you'll need
                    a capture card such as the <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/DATA-connection-video-capture-GV-USB2/dp/B00428BF1Y"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GV-USB2</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Many people play on CRT
                    TVs, and they're one of the best options if you can find one at a good price. Typically, they aren't
                    too hard to find looking on local marketplaces, but as they get harder to find, you may opt for a more modern option, such as the <a
                        href="https://www.retrotink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RetroTINK</a>, which
                    allow connection to modern monitors and TVs.
                    Lastly, for a controller you'll want to look on the SM64 discord, or ebay from a reputable seller.

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>
                    The best way to practice is using the <a
                        href="https://sites.google.com/view/supermario64/usamunepj/usamunerom" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Usamune ROM</a>.
                    For emulator, you'll want to just follow the setup guide on the site.<br>
                    For N64, you'll either need an <a href="https://krikzz.com/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">EverDrive-64</a> or a <a href="http://64drive.retroactive.be/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">64drive</a>, or you could buy a Usamune ROM cartridge
                    directly from a site like <a href="https://www.vintex64.com/store/p259/SM64_-_USAMUNE_Project.html"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vintex64</a>.
                    The EverDrive-64 and 64drive can be used for a lot more than just Usamune, so if you plan on playing
                    other games this is the recomended option. However, if you only plan on playing SM64 and are looking
                    for a lower cost option, buying the Cartridge directly is a much more cost-effective option.

                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukikipedia</a> is home to a vast amount of information regarding Super
                    Mario 64. This website was created to further the amount of easily accesible tutorials and
                    information for SM64 in a modern way, as well as provide different strats and a unique perspective
                    for some parts of the game. However, as this is a one man project, some sacrifices had to be made in
                    the development of this website, meaning some information was lost to speed up development. As such,
                    I still highly reccomend Ukikipedia for very in-depth explanations, different routes, categories,
                    and more.

                    While not needed, many runners prefer to use an autosplitter rather than manually splitting. If
